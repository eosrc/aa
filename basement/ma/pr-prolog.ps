% Here's 14 verses from the Prologue to the Gospel of John.
% Why do I think that there is nothing like it that was
% ever written? I asked myself this question and I thought
% that the 1st and 14th verses explain a lot: The Word was
% God and The Word became flesh.
% We can't imagine anything like this about God, it has to 
% be revealed.
