[
(In the beginning was the Word, and the) 
(Word was with God, and THE WORD WAS GOD.1)
(He was in the beginning with God;2)
(all things were made through him, and without) 
(him was not anything made that was made.3)
(In him was life, and the life was the light of men.4)
(The light shines in the darkness, and)
(the darkness has not overcome it.5)
()
(The true light that enlightens every) 
(man was coming into the world.9)
(He was in the world, and the world was made) 
(through him, yet the world knew him not.10)
()
(He came to his own home, and his own)
(people received him not.11)
(But to all who received him, who believed in his) 
(name, he gave power to become children of God;12)
(who were born, not of blood nor of the will of)
(the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.13)
(And THE WORD BECAME FLESH and dwelt among us,)
(full of grace and truth; we have beheld his glory,) 
(glory as of the only Son from the Father.14)
()
(And from his fulness have we all received,)
(grace upon grace.16)
(For the law was given through Moses; grace) 
(and truth came through Jesus Christ.17)
(No one has ever seen God; the only Son, who is in) 
(the bosom of the Father, he has made him known.18)
