% Tales of Metascript.ps is some postscript code to 
% implement ideas for Meta Aquinas which is the Forth version 
% of After Aquinas.

% One thing changed since the beginning of After Aquinas. 
% The sudden death of Fr. Basil, Camaldolese Hermit and prior
% of the Holy Family Hermitage in Ohio for 29 years. And 
% with the death of Fr. Paul, the year before, we hope 
% that Tales of Metascript.ps will be some kind of memorial
% for them and all the modern days successors of the Desert
% Fathers.
