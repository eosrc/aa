(        St. Romuald\302s Brief Rule)

(1. Sit in the cell as in paradise;)

(2. cast all memory of the world behind you;)

(3. cautiously watching your thoughts, as a good fisherman) 
(   watches the fish.)

(4. In the Psalms there is one way. Do not abandon it. If)
(   you, who have come with the fervor of a novice, cannot)
(   understand everything, strive to recite with understanding)
(   of spirit and mind, now here, now there, and when you)
(   begin to wander while reading, do not stop, but hasten to)
(   correct yourself by concentrating.)
   
(5. Above all, place yourself in the presence of God with fear)
(   and trembling, like someone who stands in the sight of)
(   the emperor;)

(6. destroy yourself completely,)

(7. and sit like a chick, content with the grace of God, for)
(   unless its mother gives it something, it tastes nothing and)
(   has nothing to eat.)
