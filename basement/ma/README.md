## Meta Aquinas

Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but 
when there is nothing left to take away.
*Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry*

I have described After Aquinas as Christian Wisdom using Love2d and Lua.

Since then, I have 'discovered' Forth and Meta Aquinas is going to be
Christian Wisdom using Forth as a language and philosophy.

Last week, something almost spooky happened. 
I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81bkIqPpe0g">Chuck Moore
Fireside chat Nov 2020 ~ around 10-17 min</a> and couldn't help but notice 
the similarity with After Aquinas. Moore presents a sample of around 
seventy random quotes that he has collected. They stay on the screen in 
black and white for a minute.

The After Aquinas Prototype, in the release directory of this repository,
displays random quotes, among fifty-four that I have collected and they
stay on the screen, in black and white, for 15 seconds when a star is 
clicked. 

In the Summa, the first thing that Aquinas comments about after God existence,
is God simplicity. And Dom Porion, a carthusian who died in the 80's, wrote
in his book, *The Prayer of Love and Silence*: 

God, on the contrary, is absolute simplicity. The more complicated we are, 
the further we are from God; to the contrary where we will become simple, we 
will be able to draw near to Him.

Chuck Moore has been an apostle of simplicity for more than fifty years.
I don't know his religion but I can live with Forth and his philosophy.

I imagine in the future this directory will become a repository of itself,
but I am not ready for that yet.
