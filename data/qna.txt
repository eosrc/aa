q-001 What existing means?

I think all of us can say: I exist, whatever this thing "I" may be.
Some might say, in fact, I am dreaming and the world outside does not exit.
But no one can doubt their existence.
And that is the real question: why there is something rather than nothing?
In the Christian tradition, the answer is God.

q-002 What God means?

In the book of Exodus, God tells Moise: Thus shalt thou say to them, HE 
WHO IS hath sent me to you. God's name is HE WHO IS, the fullness of
being. We exist but God exists in the full sense.

q-003 Aristotle's God is the Prime Mover (or the cause of change), what
this has to do with the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob?

Aristotle is the Philosopher, Aquinas is the Theologian. Theology tries
to understand Revelation. Saint Paul wrote: The invisible things of Him are 
clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made (Rm 1: 20).
Aristotle believed, and Aquinas agrees, that all knowledge starts in the
sense.
