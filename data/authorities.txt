God is truly and absolutely simple
De Trin. iv, 6,7
inasmuch as we exist we are good
De Doctr. Christ. i, 42
These three— 
mode, species and order— as common good things, are in everything 
God has made; thus, where these three abound the things are very 
good; where they are less, the things are less good; where they do 
not exist at all, there can be nothing good
De Nat. Boni, iii
that, the Trinity of the 
divine persons is "the supreme good, discerned by purified minds
De Trin. ii
God alone is immutable; and whatever things He has made, being from nothing, 
are mutable

Such is the power inherent in ideas, that no one can be wise unless 
they are understood
Octog. Tri. Quaest. qu. xlvi
Ideas are certain principal forms, or permanent and immutable types of 
things, they themselves not being formed. Thus they are eternal, and 
existing always in the same manner, as being contained in the divine 
intelligence. Whilst, however, they themselves neither come into 
being nor decay, yet we say that in accordance with them everything 
is formed that can rise or decay, and ali that actually does so
Octog. Tri. Quaest. qu. xlvi
Ideas are types existing in the divine mind

true body and a false unity: for it imitates unity without being unity

senses entrap us into error by their deceptive similitudes

Every efficient cause is greater than the thing effected
Qq. Ixxxiii, 28
No wise man is the 
cause of another man becoming worse. Now God surpasses ali men 
in wisdom. Much less therefore is God the cause of man becoming 
worse; and when He is said to be the cause of a thing, He is said to 
will it
Qq. 83,3
God loves all 
things that He has made, and amongst them rational creatures more,

Son Himself

Ambrose 
makes use of this division of goodness 
De Offic. i, 9
Who dares to 
call the Holy Ghost a creature, Who in all things, and everywhere, 
and always is, which assuredly belongs to the divinity alone?
De Spir. Sanet, i, 7
Some names there are 
which express evidently the property of the divinity, and some which 
express the ciear truth of the divine majesty, but others there are 
which are applied to God metaphorically by way of similitude
